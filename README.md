# Note-Taking-Application

This this a simple note taking web application.
This was done in an effort to learn React-Redux and Node.js
Much of structure for this application was learned from a tutorial found on Udemy

This application is deployed on Heroku and can be found at https://sheltered-everglades-36071.herokuapp.com/

The technologies that i used include Node.js, express, and passport.js on the backside, 
with react and redux on the front end.
I also made use of various apiâ€™s and many features inside of the languages mentioned above, such as: 
redux forms, express route handlers, and react reducers.  
I used mongoDB for keeping track of users and notes taken.
